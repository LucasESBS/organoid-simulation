    "### Stochastic Organoid Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an organoid with $n$ neurons which experiences time discretely. The state of such an organoid can be modeled as an $n$ dimensional array. If the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ element of this array is 1, then neuron $i$ is firing; ff the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ element of this array is 0, then the neuron $i$ is not firing. There is an array describing the state of the orgnoid at any given time $t$, and the state of the organoid at time $t$ should help determine the state of the organoid at time $t+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation of the state at time $t+1$ from the state at time $t$ is based probablity. In particular, consider the value $p_{i,j}$, the probability that neuron $j$ firing at time $t$ will cause neuron $i$ to fire at time $t+1$. By collecting alll these various probabilities, we can form a matrix which contains all the probabilities needed to stochastically generate the sate at time $t+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential observation here is that the probability that neuron $i$ will fire at time $t+1$ is equal to $1$ minus the probability that none of the neurons firing at time $t$ will cause neuron $i$ to fire. In mathematical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{\\mathrm{i \\; fire}} = 1 - \\prod_{j \\in F_t} (1-p_{i,j})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_t$ is the set of neurons which are firing at time $t$."

    "## Version 2 Features ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first version, the higher the number of neurons $n$, the more likely it was for any given neuron to be firing. To mitigate this problem all probabilities $P_{i,j}$ have been scaled down by a factor of $\\frac{1}{n^{|i-j|}}$. This has the affect of not only preventuing probabilities of firing from sky rocketing as $n$ increases, but also makes it so that neurons are more likely to trigger the firing of near-by neurons and are less likely to trigger distal neurons (taking index to be a proxy for  distance). We also, for the time being, remove the possibility of a neuron stimulating itself by making all the diagonal terms zero."
